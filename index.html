          The European Union (EU) is a supranational political and economic
          union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe. The
          union has a total area of 4,233,255.3 km2 (1,634,469.0 sq mi) and an
          estimated total population of nearly 447 million. The EU has often
          been described as a sui generis political entity (without precedent or
          comparison) combining the characteristics of both a federation and a
          confederation Containing 5.8 per cent of the world population in
          2020,the EU generated a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of around
          US$17.1 trillion in 2021,constituting approximately 18 per cent of
          global nominal GDP.

          <h2>begining relations</h2>
          <p>
            Relations between the European Union and the United States began in
            1953, when US diplomats visited the European Coal and Steel
            Community (the EU precursor, created in 1951) in addition to the
            national governments of its six founding countries (Belgium, France,
            Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany).The two
            parties share a good relationship which is strengthened by NATO (a
            military alliance), cooperation on trade, and shared values.
          </p>
          <h2>Formalized Cooperation</h2>
          <p>
            In 1990, the relations of the U.S. with the European Community were
            formalized by the adoption of the Transatlantic Declaration. A
            regular political dialogue between the U.S. and the EC was thereby
            initiated at various levels, including regular summit meetings. The
            cooperation focused on the areas of economy, education, science and
            culture.The New Transatlantic Agenda (NTA), which was launched at
            the Madrid summit in 1995, carried the cooperation forward. The NTA
            contains four broad objectives for U.S.-EU collaboration: promoting
            peace and stability, democracy and development around the world
            responding to global challenges; contributing to the expansion of
            world trade and closer economic relations; and building bridges
            Across the Atlantic.In connection with the adoption of the New
            Transatlantic Agenda a Joint EU-U.S. Action Plan was drawn up
            committing the EU and the U.S. to a large number of measures within
            the overall areas of cooperation.

            The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was a European
            organization created after World War II to regulate the coal and
            steel industries. It was formally established in 1951 by the Treaty
            of Paris, signed by Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the
            Netherlands, and West Germany. The ECSC was an international
            organization based on the principle of supranationalism,and started
            a process of integration which ultimately led to the creation of the
            European Union.

            The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) French:Organisation du
            traité de l'Atlantique nord, OTAN also called the North Atlantic
            Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance between 30
            member states 28 European and two North American. Established in the
            aftermath of World War II, the organization implemented the North
            Atlantic Treaty, signed in Washington, D.C., on 4 April 1949.NATO is
            a collective security system: its independent member states agree to
            defend each other against attacks by third parties. During the Cold
            War, NATO operated as a check on the perceived threat posed by the
            Soviet Union. The alliance remained in place after the dissolution
            of the Soviet Union and has been involved in military operations in
            the Balkans, the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. The
            organization's motto is animus in consulendo liber(Latin for "a mind
            unfettered in deliberation").
